I am a Senior ML scientist at [Prescient Design](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/prescient-design) in Genentech. What interests me most about machine learning models is not their strong predictive power but rather the ***why***. I often find myself asking questions like, *Why did the model make this prediction?* or *What is the model learning?* So, I do interpretability research :) I try to make neural networks more interpretable. I think understanding machine learning models better will inevitably lead us to build stronger, more powerful models. I have published over a dozen papers in top ML conferences including NeurIPs and ICLR. I received my PhD at the University of Maryland, where I was advised by [Hector Corrada Bravo](https://www.hcbravo.org/) and [Soheil Feizi](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~sfeizi/).

If you are interested in my work, want to collaborate, or just want to talk about ML and interpretability, please feel free to contact me.
